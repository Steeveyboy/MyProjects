To run the program execute ui.py to open the UI,
A basic UI will appear, from there enter the size of the grid you would like (each block is 20 by 20 px), click on an algorithm to select it, then press run,
From there a grid will be generated, use your left mouse click to select a start point, right mouse to select an endpoint, and the middle mouse to draw barriers.

Note there are still some issues with the implementation of the Depth First Search and A* algorithms.
However the Dijkstras algorithm will provide you with the fastest path.
This project was inspired by the pathfinding projects of TechWithTim and Clement Mihailescu.
Enjoy
